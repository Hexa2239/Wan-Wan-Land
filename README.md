# Wan Wan Land

An app made for Cerber's community and silly! Basically it has MinaWan running around and you can pick them up and watch them. 

# Plans

~~I plan on adding a green screen mode so if a streamer wanted to import their own sprites they could have a greenscreen to have it as a background in their streams.~~
Greenscreen Mode finished,

- I want to add the ability to disable random colours,
- The ability to force a certain color on the Minawan
